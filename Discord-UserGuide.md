# 🧭 BuildaDAO | The Caravan — Discord Server User Guide (v16)
_Tagline: “From the BaDlands.”_

Welcome to **BuildaDAO | The Caravan**, a community of builders, artists, and innovators traveling the path toward decentralized creation.  
This guide explains how to use the server, collaborate on projects, and navigate BuildaDAO’s hub-and-spoke system.

---

## 🌍 1. Welcome & Overview

**The Caravan** is where BuildaDAO organizes and executes decentralized projects.  
The server is designed like a living workspace:  
- **RaceTrack** is the main hub where all projects are tracked.  
- **Working Forums** (like Governance, Operations, Marketing, BizDev, Technologia) are the spokes that make the work happen.  
- Each project links back to its RaceTrack thread through the `[Project-Link]` tag.

When in doubt:
> “If it’s a project, it lives on the RaceTrack.  
> If it’s a task, it lives in a forum.  
> If it’s an idea, it starts as a discussion.”

---

## 🗺 2. Navigating the Server

The Caravan is organized into clear categories:

### 🏕️ Ground Zero (Main Hub)
The public and onboarding space.
- **#welcome** — Start here. Learn what BuildaDAO is and how to get involved.  
- **#announcements** — DAO-wide news, proposals, events, and updates.  
- **#links** — Official resources (website, GitHub, Notion, social).  
- **#general** — Open community discussion.  
- **#share-your-work** — Show off creative work, projects, or progress.

### ⚙️ Working Forums
Spaces where DAO contributors coordinate by domain:
- **Governance** — Proposals, voting, and policy discussions.  
- **Operations** — Treasury, logistics, and backend execution.  
- **Marketing** — Branding, campaigns, and storytelling.  
- **BizDev** — Partnerships, sponsorships, and ecosystem growth.  
- **Technologia** — Smart contracts, infrastructure, and tooling.  
- **Admin** — Internal systems (restricted to staff).

Each forum is **thread-based**, with tags organizing content by purpose or project.

### 🏁 RaceTrack (Project Hub)
Central dashboard for all active and archived projects.  
Each thread = one project.  
Comments are restricted to moderators and bots for clarity.  
Threads link to relevant forum discussions via `[Project-Link]`.

### 🧗 Proving Ground
The training and experimentation arena.  
Used for hackathons, challenges, and mentorship programs.

## 🏷️ 3. Posting & Tagging

Tags keep threads organized and searchable. Use them consistently.

### **Universal Tags**
`[Discussion]` — Brainstorming, open conversation, or feedback.  
`[Task]` — Actionable items or assignments.  
`[Priority]` — Urgent or time-sensitive issues.  
`[Project-Link]` — Links thread to a RaceTrack project (e.g. `#Baobab`).  
`[Documentation]` — Marks a completed or archived record.

### **Working Group-Specific Tags**
Each forum has extra tags related to its function (e.g., `[Proposal]`, `[Campaign]`, `[Treasury]`, `[Build]`).

### **When to Use Each**
| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `[Discussion]` | Starting an open topic or idea | “Should we accept sponsorships for #Baobab?” |
| `[Task]` | Creating a specific deliverable | “Design Baobab campaign graphics.” |
| `[Priority]` | Highlighting urgent items | “Finalize DAO Treasury TX before Friday.” |
| `[Project-Link]` | Connecting to RaceTrack | “Linked to #Baobab Project.” |
| `[Documentation]` | Wrapping up work | “Project summary and TX record posted.” |

---

## 🏁 4. RaceTrack System

**RaceTrack** is the core of BuildaDAO’s workflow.

Each **project** has:
- A **thread** in RaceTrack.
- **Linked threads** across forums (tagged `[Project-Link]`).
- A clear start and completion point.

### Example Flow
1. Governance approves a `[Proposal]` → creates RaceTrack thread: `Project Baobab`.  
2. Operations posts `[Treasury][Task][Project-Link] Execute Multisig Payout for #Baobab`.  
3. Marketing posts `[Campaign][Task][Project-Link] Baobab Launch Campaign`.  
4. Technologia posts `[Build][Task][Project-Link] Deploy Contract`.  
5. BizDev posts `[Partner][Task][Project-Link] ETHDenver Sponsorship`.  
6. All threads sync back to the RaceTrack index.

When the project completes:
- RaceTrack thread gets tagged `[Complete]`.  
- Linked posts in forums get `[Documentation]`.

## 🪶 6. Best Practices

**Keep communication structured:**
- Start new posts only when needed.  
- Always apply at least one tag.  
- Add `[Project-Link]` if connected to a RaceTrack project.  
- Use comments for updates, not entirely new threads.

**Collaborate respectfully:**
- Use clear titles: “Design Campaign for #Baobab” > “Need help.”  
- Don’t spam mentions; use `@WG` roles when relevant.  
- Summarize progress often — “Update 2/10: Assets finalized.”  
- When done, tag `[Documentation]`.

## ⚡ 11. Core Philosophy

**Autonomy + Alignment.**  
Every member acts independently within the DAO’s consensus.  
No one person’s preferences override collective decision-making.  
Consensus and transparency are our core values.

> “The Caravan moves together — each step leaving a trail others can follow.”

## ✅ Final Notes
- Check pinned messages for templates and RaceTrack updates.  
- Always tag your posts properly — it’s how projects stay discoverable.  
- Remember: Discord is the conversation space, GitHub is the record.

Welcome to **The Caravan.** 🏜️  
Build boldly, travel together.
