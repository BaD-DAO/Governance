# 🧭 BuildaDAO | The Caravan — Discord Server User Guide (v17)
_Tagline: “From the BaDlands.”_

Welcome to **BuildaDAO | The Caravan**, a community of builders, artists, and innovators traveling the path toward decentralized creation.  
This guide explains how to use the server, collaborate on projects, and navigate BuildaDAO’s hub-and-spoke system.

---

## 🌍 1. Welcome & Overview

**The Caravan** is where BuildaDAO organizes and executes decentralized projects.  
The server is designed like a living workspace:  
- **RaceTrack** is the main hub where all projects are tracked.  
- **Working Forums** (Governance, Operations, Marketing, BizDev, Technologia) are the spokes that make the work happen.  
- Each project is referenced directly by **linking its RaceTrack thread** with a `#` mention (e.g., `#Baobab`).

When in doubt:
> “If it’s a project, it lives on the RaceTrack.  
> If it’s a task, it lives in a forum.  
> If it’s an idea, it starts as a discussion.”

---

## 🗺 2. Navigating the Server

### 🏕️ Ground Zero (Main Hub)
- **#welcome** — Start here. Learn what BuildaDAO is and how to get involved.  
- **#announcements** — DAO-wide news, proposals, events, and updates.  
- **#links** — Official resources (website, GitHub, Notion, social).  
- **#general** — Open community discussion.  
- **#share-your-work** — Show off creative work, projects, or progress.

### ⚙️ Working Forums
- **Governance** — Proposals, voting, and policy.  
- **Operations** — Treasury, logistics, and backend execution.  
- **Marketing** — Branding, campaigns, and storytelling.  
- **BizDev** — Partnerships, sponsorships, and ecosystem growth.  
- **Technologia** — Smart contracts, infrastructure, and tooling.  
- **Admin** — Internal systems (restricted).

Each forum is **thread-based**, with tags organizing content by purpose.

### 🏁 RaceTrack (Project Hub)
Central dashboard for all active and archived projects.  
Each thread = one project.  
Comments are restricted to moderators and bots for clarity.  
Working-forum threads **reference their project** by mentioning the RaceTrack thread (e.g., `#First500Campaign`).

### 🧗 Proving Ground
Training and experimentation: hackathons, challenges, workshops.

## 🏷️ 3. Posting & Tagging

Tags keep threads organized and searchable. Use them consistently.

### **Universal Tags**
`[Discussion]` — Brainstorming, open conversation, or feedback.  
`[Task]` — Actionable items or assignments.  
`[Priority]` — Urgent or time-sensitive issues.  
`[Documentation]` — Marks a completed or archived record.

> When a thread belongs to a project, **mention the RaceTrack thread** using `#` in the title or first line.

### **Working Group-Specific Tags**
Each forum adds tags suited to its function (e.g., Governance: `[Proposal][Vote]`; Technologia: `[Build][Test][Bug]`; Operations: `[Treasury][DevOps]`; Marketing: `[Campaign][Event]`; BizDev: `[Partner][Outreach]`; Admin: `[System][Permissions]`).

### **When to Use Each**
| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `[Discussion]` | Start an open topic or idea | “Should we accept sponsorships for #Baobab?” |
| `[Task]` | Create a specific deliverable | “Design Baobab campaign graphics — see #Baobab.” |
| `[Priority]` | Highlight urgent items | “Finalize Treasury TX for #First500Campaign by Friday.” |
| `[Documentation]` | Wrap up work | “Project summary posted — see #First500Campaign.” |

## 🏁 4. RaceTrack System

**RaceTrack** is the core of BuildaDAO’s workflow.

Each **project** has:
- A **thread** in RaceTrack.  
- **Related threads** across forums that mention the RaceTrack thread with `#`.  
- A clear start and completion point.

### Example Flow
1. Governance approves a `[Proposal]` → create RaceTrack thread: `#ProjectBaobab`.  
2. Operations posts `[Treasury][Task] Execute Multisig Payout for #ProjectBaobab`.  
3. Marketing posts `[Campaign][Task] Baobab Launch — see #ProjectBaobab`.  
4. Technologia posts `[Build][Task] Deploy Contract — see #ProjectBaobab`.  
5. BizDev posts `[Partner][Task] ETHDenver Sponsorship — see #ProjectBaobab`.  
6. All threads reference back to the RaceTrack index via `#ProjectBaobab`.

When the project completes:
- RaceTrack thread gets tagged `[Complete]`.  
- Related forum threads get `[Documentation]`.

## ⚡ 11. Core Philosophy

**Autonomy + Alignment.**  
Every member acts independently within the DAO’s consensus.  
No one person’s preferences override collective decision-making.  
Consensus and transparency are our core values.

> “The Caravan moves together — each step leaving a trail others can follow.”

## ✅ Final Notes
- Check pinned messages for templates and RaceTrack updates.  
- Always tag your posts properly — it’s how projects stay discoverable.  
- Remember: Discord is the conversation space, GitHub is the record.

Welcome to **The Caravan.** 🏜️  
Build boldly, travel together.
