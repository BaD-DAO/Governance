# **BuildaDAO: Devconnect Buenos Aires 2025 Crowdfunding Project**

## **Project Overview**
BuildaDAO will send a team of African builders to **Devconnect Buenos Aires (Nov 15–23, 2025)** to represent Africa’s Web3 innovation on the global stage.  
Our goal is to **document, participate in, and connect African founders with global protocols and DAO researchers**.  
The project strengthens collaboration between African coordination experiments and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

---

## **Theory of Change**
When African DAO builders directly engage with global coordination events, they bring back proven frameworks, governance models, and relationships that accelerate local adoption.  
By documenting, sharing, and applying those learnings across active African DAOs, we can reduce the gap between emerging market realities and global protocol design.

**Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes:**

Funding travel + participation → Event engagement and research → Public reports and content → Strengthened DAO operations and partnerships across Africa.

---

## **Scope of Work**
The project covers three focus areas:

1. **Representation & Research** – Participate in governance, coordination, and DAO tracks, and collect models applicable to African DAOs.  
2. **Documentation & Media** – Capture learnings through interviews, photography, and short video reflections.  
3. **Community & Partnerships** – Build lasting relationships with other DAOs, protocols, and public-goods projects.

## **Fund Management**
Funds will be held in a **three-signature multisig** managed by the Governance, Finance, and Media leads.

**Disbursement Schedule:**
- **Milestone 1:** Travel & logistics (40%)  
- **Milestone 2:** Event execution (40%)  
- **Milestone 3:** Post-event reporting (20%)  

All spending will be publicly tracked in the DAO’s **treasury dashboard**.

---

## **Risk and Mitigation**

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|-----------|----------------|
| Travel or visa delays | Book flights and apply early; maintain alternate delegate list. |
| Budget overrun | Maintain 10% contingency; preapprove expenses. |
| Media access restrictions | Request permissions in advance from organizers. |
| Delegate unavailability | Assign backups for each role and cross-train responsibilities. |

---

## **Transparency and Reporting**
All deliverables will be publicly verifiable:
- Reports and media archived to **IPFS/Arweave**.  
- On-chain transaction logs shared through the **DAO treasury**.  
- Summary posted to **HACMD and DAO communication channels** within 30 days post-event.

---

## **Stretch Goal**
If additional funding is available (**+$5,000**), BuildaDAO will host a **public Devconnect side workshop** titled:

> “Constraint-Driven Design: African DAO Models in Practice.”

This event would highlight African coordination case studies and invite cross-DAO collaboration.

---

## **Strategic Alignment with HACMD**
This initiative supports HACMD’s mission to strengthen DAO coordination and cross-ecosystem research by:
- Adding **Global South representation** to governance conversations.  
- Sharing **open-source research outputs** accessible to HACMD’s knowledge base.  
- Expanding **builder diversity and project visibility** within the HACMD network.

---

## **Communication Plan**
One delegate will serve as **Communications Lead**, responsible for:
- Live updates during Devconnect (**Twitter, Farcaster, Lens**).  
- Daily media coordination and partner tagging.  
- Compiling a **post-event social recap** and **visual assets folder**.

---

## **Summary**
Even a **single delegate** brings measurable value through learning and representation.  
A **full six-person team** delivers complete research, documentation, and partnership impact.  

The project is ready for **HACMD submission** — complete with deliverables, milestones, reporting structure, and clear metrics that demonstrate measurable **public value for the global Web3 community**.
